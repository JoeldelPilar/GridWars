# GRIDWARS

## About

GridWars is a basic web app game in the style of "Battleship". It was created as a school project to get started with "socket.io". <br>
None of the us had any previous experience working with socket.io or similar technologies before. Also the JavaScript framework <br>
was new to most of us.

## Get started

Here you can se the projekt live: [GridWars](https://gridwarsfront-wenm4.ondigitalocean.app/) <br>
(!Disclaimer: The backend server may not be running after April 2023)

If the live server is down you may demo this app, just follow these steps:

1. Clone this repo and save it locally on your machine.

2. Open the root folder that contains both "Backend" and "Frontend" dir.

3. <b>Backend</b>
   (for ease of use we recomend that you have nodemon installed)

- cd in to backend folder.
- type `npm install` in your terminal followed by:
- `nodemon start`

Now the server should be up and running!

4. <b>Frontend</b>

- cd in to frontend folder.
- type `npm install` in your terminal followed by:
- `npm run dev`

Now you should be given a url in your terminal, `ctrl` + `left click` on that url to open in browser.

Now the app is running and should work according to current version.
